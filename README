DJVULIBRE-SHAPE-TOOLS
=====================

INFO
====
exportshapes is a tool for extracting shape libraries from DjVu documents
into a MySQL database. 

The work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education's 
grant no. N N519 384036 (cf. https://bitbucket.org/jsbien/ndt). 

COMPILATION
===========

Currently it needs to be compiled as part of a fork of djvulibre.
To compile it from the main folder type:

./configure
make depend
make
cd tools
make exportshapes

USAGE
=====

To use exportshapes, you need to provide it with a database name, host name, username, password and
a filename to process. This will extract all shapes from the given document 

./exportshapes [-i | -c | -o] [-t <page #>] [-f <page #>] -u <username> -p <password> -h <host> -d <database> <file.djvu>

Options -u, -p, -h, -d supply required parameters.

Option -i inject required tables into the given database.

Option -c creates a database of the given name and then injects required tables as the previous option does.

Option -o does the same as -c, but also drops the database first, if it exists already. Good for testing.

Option -f: its argument specifies a page number from which the processing should start.

Option -t: its argument specifies a limit to the number of pages processed by the program.

E.g. "exportshapes -f 5 -t 10 [...]" would export shapes from pages 5,6,7,8,9 and 10.

DATABASE STRUCTURE
==================

dictionary_id INT not null, --references table of dictionaries
bbox_top INT, bbox_left INT, bbox_right INT, bbox_bottom INT -- bounding box


TABLE blits: -- shapes' locations in document
id INT not null auto_increment primary key,
document_id INT not null, -- references table of documents
page_number INT not null,

document varchar(60) not null


TABLE dictionaries: -- dictionaries stored in the database
id INT not null auto_increment primary key,
dictionary_name varchar(60) not null,
page_number INT not null, -- which page this dictionary belongs to, inherited dictionaries have -1 in this field
